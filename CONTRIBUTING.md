## Prequirities

This repository serves as a code base for the discord bot "**Guild Planner**" whose main purpose and goal is to add increased efficency for World of Warcraft guilds using discord as their primary communication tool.


## Pull Requests

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


## Code style
Even though no code style plugin yet has been added, every finalized implementation should include professional and good looking code. 

For reference, see the [w3schools javascript style manual](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp).
